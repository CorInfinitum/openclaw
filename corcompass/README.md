## How to Use This System

### For a New Agent Session

1. Load `core-identity/SOUL.md` — establishes the CorCompass collective identity
2. Load `core-identity/STYLE.md` — establishes voice and formatting standards
3. Load `core-identity/AGENTS.md` — establishes universal operating principles
4. Load the relevant `role-skills/[agent-name].md` — establishes domain expertise
5. Load any relevant `reference/` files for the specific task

### For Building a New Agent Role

Follow the five-phase curriculum in `curriculum/CURRICULUM.md`. Use the prompts in `curriculum/prompts/` in sequence. Do not skip phases.

### For Improving an Existing Agent

Use the Phase 5 prompts in `curriculum/prompts/phase-3-5-prompts.md`. Run the weekly performance review (Prompt 5.4) to systematically improve any agent over time.

## Core Principles

Every CorCompass agent embodies three principles:

**Guided by Heart** — Every interaction begins with understanding what the client actually needs, not just what they asked for. Emotional intelligence is not soft; it is the most important capability in a luxury consulting context.

**Powered by Logic** — Every recommendation is grounded in evidence, structured reasoning, and quantified where possible. We do not guess; we assess. We do not hedge; we calibrate.

**Coherent** — Heart and Logic must point in the same direction. An agent that is warm but imprecise is not a CorCompass agent. An agent that is precise but cold is not a CorCompass agent. Both dimensions must be present in every interaction.

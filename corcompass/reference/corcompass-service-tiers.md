## Flow Scan — Entry Tier

### What It Is

A diagnostic engagement designed to give clients clarity about their AI opportunity before they commit to implementation. The Flow Scan produces a Blueprint: a structured assessment of where AI can create the most value in the client's specific context.

### What It Includes

- 90-minute intake conversation (Compass-led)
- HeartCor Alignment Assessment
- AI Opportunity Map: the top 3–5 workflows where AI would create the most value
- Prioritized recommendation: where to start and why
- Implementation roadmap: what a Coherence Sprint would look like for the top priority
- "Your Atelier Blueprint" document delivered within 5 business days

### Who It's For

- Clients who are curious about AI but have not yet identified a specific use case
- Clients who have tried AI tools but have not seen meaningful results
- Clients who want an expert opinion before making a larger investment
- Clients whose HeartCor Coherence assessment is Medium or Low

### What It Is Not

- A full implementation (that is Coherence Sprint or Harbor Build)
- A generic AI overview or education session
- A sales pitch for a larger engagement (though it often leads to one)

### Conversion Signal

A Flow Scan client is ready to convert to Coherence Sprint when:
- They have reviewed the Blueprint and identified the priority they want to pursue
- They have confirmed budget availability for the next phase
- They have identified a team member who will own the implementation

---

## Coherence Sprint — Mid Tier

### What It Is

A focused, time-boxed implementation engagement designed to solve one specific, well-defined problem with AI. The Coherence Sprint produces a working solution — not a plan, not a prototype, but something the client can use in production.

### What It Includes

- Detailed scoping session (Waypoint-led)
- Custom OpenClaw agent configuration (Atelier-built)
- Integration with existing tools and workflows
- Team training and handoff documentation
- 30-day post-delivery support
- Waypoint Check at the midpoint and end of the engagement

### Who It's For

- Clients who have completed a Flow Scan and identified their priority
- Clients who come in with a specific, well-defined problem
- Clients who have budget clarity and team capacity for implementation
- Clients whose HeartCor Coherence assessment is High

### What It Is Not

- A multi-problem transformation (that is Harbor Build)
- An open-ended consulting retainer
- A technology selection or vendor evaluation

### Conversion Signal

A Coherence Sprint client is ready to convert to Harbor Build when:
- They have achieved strong results from the Sprint and want to expand
- They have identified multiple additional problems that AI could solve
- They have executive buy-in for a longer-term AI transformation

---

## Harbor Build — Deep Tier

### What It Is

A long-term strategic partnership designed to transform the client's operations through systematic AI integration. Harbor Build is not a project — it is a relationship. CorCompass becomes an embedded part of the client's team, continuously building, refining, and expanding their AI capabilities.

### What It Includes

- Dedicated CorCompass team (Compass + Atelier + Waypoint + Harbor)
- Monthly strategic reviews (Compass-led)
- Continuous agent development and refinement (Atelier-led)
- Quarterly HeartCor Alignment Reviews
- Priority access to new CorCompass capabilities as they are developed
- Annual Blueprint Review: full reassessment of the AI opportunity landscape

### Who It's For

- Clients with multiple interconnected problems that require a systematic approach
- Clients with executive buy-in and a long-term vision for AI transformation
- Clients who have demonstrated results from a Coherence Sprint and want to scale
- Clients in industries where AI advantage compounds over time (hospitality, professional services)

### What It Is Not

- A staffing arrangement (CorCompass agents are not employees)
- An unlimited scope engagement (each Harbor Build has a defined scope that is reviewed annually)
- A technology management contract (CorCompass does not manage infrastructure)

## Tier Selection Decision Framework

Use this framework when the client's tier is not obvious:

1. **Can the client articulate a specific problem?**
   - No → Flow Scan
   - Yes → continue to question 2

2. **Is the HeartCor Coherence level High?**
   - No (Medium or Low) → Flow Scan
   - Yes → continue to question 3

3. **Is the problem scope limited to one or two workflows?**
   - Yes → Coherence Sprint
   - No (multiple interconnected problems) → continue to question 4

4. **Does the client have executive buy-in and long-term vision?**
   - Yes → Harbor Build
   - No → Coherence Sprint with a note to revisit Harbor Build after results are demonstrated

## Pricing Principles

- Pricing is value-based, not time-based. We price based on the value created, not the hours spent.
- Never compete on price. If a client is price-shopping, they are not ready for CorCompass.
- The Flow Scan price should feel like a low-risk investment, not a significant commitment.
- The Coherence Sprint price should feel proportional to the problem being solved.
- Harbor Build pricing is negotiated individually based on scope and client size.
- All pricing is subject to change. Always confirm current rates before quoting.

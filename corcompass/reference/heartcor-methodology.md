## What Is HeartCor?

HeartCor is CorCompass's proprietary framework for diagnosing and resolving the misalignment between what organizations want to achieve (Heart), what their operations can actually support (Logic), and whether those two dimensions are pointing in the same direction (Coherence).

Most AI implementations fail not because the technology is wrong, but because the Heart and Logic dimensions are misaligned. HeartCor identifies and resolves that misalignment before it becomes an expensive failure.

## The Three Dimensions

### Heart — What They Actually Care About

Heart is the emotional and values layer: what the client genuinely wants, what they are afraid of losing, what success feels like to them. Heart is not always what the client says they want — it is what they mean.

**Diagnostic questions:**
- "If this project succeeds completely, what does your life look like differently?"
- "What would you be most disappointed to lose if this doesn't work out?"
- "What does your best day at work look like?"
- "What keeps you up at night about this?"

**Common Heart misalignments:**
- Client says they want efficiency; they actually want control
- Client says they want AI automation; they actually want to feel less overwhelmed
- Client says they want a dashboard; they actually want confidence in their decisions

### Logic — What Their Operations Can Actually Support

Logic is the operational layer: what the client's current systems, team, budget, and processes can actually support. Logic is not a constraint to be overcome — it is a reality to be respected.

**Diagnostic questions:**
- "What does your team's current workload look like?"
- "What systems are you already using that any new solution needs to integrate with?"
- "What is your realistic budget for this, including implementation and ongoing maintenance?"
- "Who on your team will own this after we build it?"

**Common Logic misalignments:**
- Client wants a sophisticated AI system; their team has no capacity to maintain it
- Client wants fast implementation; their approval process takes 6 weeks
- Client wants full automation; their data quality is too poor to automate reliably

### Coherence — Are Heart and Logic Pointing the Same Direction?

Coherence is the alignment between Heart and Logic. A coherent engagement is one where what the client wants is achievable with what they have. An incoherent engagement is one where the Heart and Logic dimensions are in conflict.

**Coherence assessment:**
- **High Coherence:** The client's goals are achievable with their current resources. Proceed with confidence.
- **Medium Coherence:** The client's goals are achievable with some adjustments to scope, timeline, or resources. Negotiate the adjustments before proceeding.
- **Low Coherence:** The client's goals are not achievable with their current resources. Do not proceed without resolving the gap — this is a setup for failure.

## Applying HeartCor in Practice

### The Intake Assessment

During intake, the Compass agent applies HeartCor by:
1. Asking Heart questions to understand what the client actually wants
2. Asking Logic questions to understand what their operations can support
3. Assessing Coherence: are these two dimensions aligned?
4. Documenting the HeartCor Alignment Summary (3–5 sentences)

### The HeartCor Alignment Summary

The summary should answer three questions:
1. What does this client's Heart want? (one sentence)
2. What does their Logic support? (one sentence)
3. What is the Coherence level, and what does it mean for the engagement? (one to two sentences)

**Example:**
> This client's Heart wants to feel in control of their business again after a period of rapid growth that has left them feeling reactive. Their Logic supports a focused, 90-day engagement with a dedicated team member who can own the implementation. Coherence is high — their goals are achievable with their current resources, and the primary risk is scope creep as they discover new problems during the engagement.

### When Coherence Is Low

When Coherence is low, the Compass agent must address it before recommending a service tier. Options:
1. **Scope reduction:** Can the Heart dimension be satisfied with a smaller, more achievable version of the goal?
2. **Resource expansion:** Can the Logic dimension be expanded (more budget, more team capacity) to support the Heart dimension?
3. **Expectation reset:** Can the client be helped to understand why their current goals are not achievable, and what a realistic goal looks like?

Do not proceed with a low-Coherence engagement without explicit client acknowledgment of the gap and agreement on how to address it.

## HeartCor in Service Tier Selection

| Coherence Level | Recommended Tier | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| High + Clear Goals | Coherence Sprint or Harbor Build | Ready to execute; don't slow them down |
| High + Unclear Goals | Flow Scan | Clarity before commitment |
| Medium | Flow Scan → Coherence Sprint | Use Flow Scan to resolve the gap, then proceed |
| Low | Flow Scan only | Do not commit to a larger engagement until Coherence is established |

## Common HeartCor Patterns

| Pattern | Heart Signal | Logic Signal | Coherence | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "We need AI now" | Fear of being left behind | No AI infrastructure, no data strategy | Low | Slow down; start with Flow Scan |
| "Automate everything" | Overwhelm, desire for control | Small team, manual processes | Medium | Scope to one workflow first |
| "Build us a chatbot" | Wants to look innovative | No clear use case, no training data | Low | Reframe around actual problem |
| "Improve our efficiency" | Wants more time for strategic work | Has clear processes, willing to invest | High | Proceed with Coherence Sprint |
| "We want what [competitor] has" | Competitive anxiety | Has budget and team capacity | Medium | Validate the actual need first |
